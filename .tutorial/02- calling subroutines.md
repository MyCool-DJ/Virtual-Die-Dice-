# How do we call the subroutine?

We call it in the same way as before. However, instead of leaving the `()` blank, we send the code a message.

ðŸ‘‰ What happens when you add this to the end of your code above?

```python    
whichCake("chocolate")
```

That's right. The variable 'ingredient' in the subroutine gets set to 'chocolate' and the output shows:

### ðŸ‘‰ What happens if you change "ingredient" to "broccoli"?
