# ðŸ‘‰ Day 24 Challenge


Let's build an infinity dice!


- Create subroutines that will roll a dice with any number of sides (essentially as big of a number as you like).
Write one subroutine with one parameter that allows us to call a function (such as rollDice).

```
Example:

Infinity Dice ðŸŽ²

How many sides?: 600
You rolled 532

Roll again? yes
You rolled 102

Roll again? no
```

- Import your library first.
- Create a variable to ask the user how many sides the dice should be.
- Create a variable that allows the user to leave the game.
- Create a subroutine with rollDice that sets the sides of the dice as the argument.
- Create a `while` loop that allows the user to roll again or leave the game.
